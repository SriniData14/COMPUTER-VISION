🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using CNN
A deep learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain MRI images into tumor types (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or no tumor). This project leverages a custom-trained CNN model to assist radiologists with faster and more accurate diagnosis.


🔍 Features
Preprocessing of MRI scans (resizing, normalization, data augmentation)

CNN architecture built using TensorFlow/Keras

Training with labeled dataset (e.g., Kaggle’s Brain MRI dataset)

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Streamlit web app for uploading and predicting brain tumor type

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Streamlit (for deployment)

📁 Dataset
Used the Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection dataset from Kaggle. Contains T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI scans labeled by tumor type.
